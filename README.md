# midi
I'll redo some midi work from some years ago, when Turbo Pascal and MIDI (standard for music digitalization) were a thing.

This time I'll code using C# and the Visual Studio ecosystem.

If you're into MIDI, C# and VisualStudio, you're welcome to contribute.

Some goals are:

- Get chord sheets from MIDI files.
- Get lyrics and chords from KAR or MIDI-Karaoke files.
- Extract "styles" from MIDI tracks.
- Re-create MIDI files using different track "styles".
- Being able to collect multiple MIDI files with same soloist track (e.g. Slash) and being able to generate a random solo with the same artist's style with a different chord progression.
- Generate beauty chord, lyrics and partiture printable pages.
- Generate files based on MIDI data and real life sound samples.
- Being able to contribute online with artists all over the world.
- Put it all together in a fantastic user interface with the most awesome user experience.

Ok. I know this is a lot and there are already awesome products like "Band in a Box (BiaB)". But, for some reason, I feel like BiaB first objective is to produce quality output, which is really a very good thing, but the UX and the experimental side for real musicians, is not having enough support in the software industry and this is my effort to fill this gap.
